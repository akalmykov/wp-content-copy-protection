The WP Content Copy Protection plugin uses multiple techniques in protecting your valuable blog content from being stolen.

== Description ==

WP Content Copy Protection is a simple plugin that uses multiple techniques in protecting your blog content from being copied illegally. Some of the most common copy methods, such as right-click, image dragging, and keyboard copy shortcuts, such as CTRL A, C, X, U, and P are disabled with this plugin. 

Basic Features:

* iFrame Protection
* Disables right click function on mouse
* Disables image drag and drop functionality
* Disables 'Hold to Copy' function on most mobile devices
* Displays a client-side error message when Javascript is disabled in user's browser
* Serves blank pages when JS is disabled in user's browser (user is forced to enable JS)
* Disables keyboard copy commands (CTRL A, C, X, U, P) select all|copy|paste|print|view source
* The image link URL is automatically removed and defaulted to the 'none' setting in your image upload settings (deters image theft)

Pro Version Features include:

* Admin can exclude specific pages from being copy protected (globally)
* Admin can disable copy protection for logged in/registered users (globally)
* Aggressive image protection (makes it near impossible for users to steal your pictures)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will WP Content Copy Protection Plugin have a negative impact on my SEO? =

Absolutely not! This plugin will only affect the user's browser (attempting to copy your content) and will have absolutely no negative impact on your SEO.

= Will this plugin disable the features from the site administrator also? =

Yes! However, our Pro version allows the blog administrator to enable/disable copy protect functions for registered and logged in users (globally)

= Will your WP Content Copy Protection Plugin affect my Advertising Units (Adsense)? =

Absolutely not! Although this plugin locks your content and prevents it from being copied by anyone else, your advertising units will remain unaffected as the code doesn't alter any embeddable code or the functioning thereof.

= Why Did you Exclude The alert-message (Popup), Function? =

This function was removed simply because it could scare away your website visitors - cause a higher bounce rate - and essentially defame your website. We like to be 'silent'!

= Does your Plugin work on all major Browsers? =

This plugin works on all major browsers. The full functionality (features) was tested on the latest versions of IE (Internet Explorer), Mozilla FF, and Chrome without any problems. Our plugin is also compatible with all major theme frameworks.

= What is the difference between the free version and the pro version? =

The pro version includes advanced image protection (making it near impossible for a user to copy/steal your images), RSS feed protection against content scraping software/autoblogs and, backend admin switches.
