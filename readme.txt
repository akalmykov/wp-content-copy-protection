The WP Content Copy Protection plugin uses multiple techniques in copy-protecting your valuable blog content !


== Description ==

WP Content Copy Protection is a simple plugin that uses multiple techniques in copy-protecting your blog content. Some of the most common copy methods, such as right click, image dragging, and keyboard copy shortcuts such as CTRL A, C, X, U, and P are disabled with this plugin. 

While this will most certainly help copy-protect your content, do remember that there are many other means one could use to get their hands on your content without using the context menu.

See our Pro Version in action [HERE](http://www.securiilock.com/)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will WP Content Copy Protection Plugin have a negative impact on my SEO? =

No! This plugin will only affect the user's browser (attempting to copy your content) and will have absolutely no negative impact on your SEO.

= Will this plugin disable the features from the site administrator also? =

Yes! However, our Pro version allows the blog administrator to enable/disable copy protect functions for registered and logged in users (globally)

= Will your WP Content Copy Protection Plugin affect my Advertising (Adsense)? =

Absolutely not! Although this plugin locks your content and prevents it from being copied by anyone else, your advertising units will remain unaffected as the code doesn't alter any embeddable code or the functioning thereof.

= Why Did you Exclude The 'alert-message' (Popup) Function? =

This function was removed simply becasue it could scare away your website visitors - cause a higher bounce rate - and essentially defame your website. We like to be 'silent' !

= Does your Plugin work on all major Browsers? =

This plugin works on all major browsers. The full functionality (features) of this plugin was tested on the latest versions of IE (Internet Explorer), Mozilla FF, and Chrome without any problems.
