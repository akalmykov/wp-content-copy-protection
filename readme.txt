The WP Content Copy Protection plugin uses multiple techniques in copy-protecting your blog.


== Description ==

WP Content Copy Protection is a simple plugin that uses multiple techniques in copy-protecting your blog content. Some of the most common copy methods, such as right click, image dragging, text selection, as well as keyboard copy shortcuts such as CTRL A, C, X, and U, are disabled with this plugin. There is nothing to administrate here, simply plug in and go!

__Please Note__

While this will most certainly help copy-protect your content, do remember that there are many other means one could use to get their hands on your content without using the context menu.

1. Disable right click function on mouse
2. Disable text selection and drag function on mouse
3. Disable image drag and drop function
4. Disable combo keyboard command (CTRL A, C, X, U, P) functions (No 'Select all', 'Copy', 'Cut', 'Paste', 'View Source', or Print via Keyboard)
5. Disable 'Hold to Copy' function on some mobile devices (Such as iOS)
6. Protect from iFrames (Full Protection) // ADDED : Forces other sites to load your side outside the frame
7. Displays a client-side error message when Javascript is disabled AND serves the client with blank pages until Javascript is enabled

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will WP Content Copy Protection Plugin have a negative impact on my SEO? =

No! This plugin will only affect the user's browser (attempting to copy your content) and will have NO negative impact on your SEO.

= Will this plugin disable the features from the site administrator also? =

The plugin will disable the given features for everyone (including site administration) at this stage. However, we are looking to disable this in our update.

= I need to Hard Refresh (CTRL + F5) my Page, but the CTRL Key Function is Locked. What now? = 

Simply move your mouse pointer into your browser's URL (address) bar and then execute CTRL + F5 for a hard refresh. This function will (like all other content protection measures through the plugin), remain UN-executable in the current window, however, trigger from the URL/address bar. This was tested on all major browsers (latest versions).

= Will your WP Content Copy Protection Plugin affect my Advertising (Adsense)? =

Absolutely not! Although this plugin locks your content and prevents it from being copied by anyone else, your advertising blocks will remain UN-touched and UN-affected. These blocks will function without any trouble, and will work with Adsense, Chitika, as well as most other advertising programs.

= Why Did you Exclude The 'alert-message' (Popup) Function? =

This function was removed mainly due to the fact that it could scare away your website visitors - cause a higher bounce rate - and essentially defame your website.

= Does your Plugin work on all major Browsers? =

This plugin works on all major browsers. The full functionality (features) of this plugin was tested on the latest versions of IE (Internet Explorer), Mozilla FF, and Chrome without any problems.

= How do I manually Disable my Image Link URL as Users Can Still LEFT Click on my Images? =

When uploading an image to your blog post - simply select the 'none' option just below your link URL (in the image uploading window). This will disable the LEFT click function on the image. The plugin will take care of the rest!

= How do I Change The Javascript Error Message? = 

Should you wish to change the current Javascript error message, simple go to Line: 35 in the fwpconsec.php file and change it there (replace the existing message). Our upcoming version will include the necessary administration.

= How do I Change the Background Color of the JS Error Message from Yellow? =

Once again, navigate to Line: 35 in the fwpconsec.php file and change it there. The current color code is: #FFF000 (Yellow). You can also change your font and font size here.

= How do I Disable the Javascript Error? =

Should you wish to NOT use the Javascript error message, simply go to fwpconsec.php and hash out Line: 33 - 36.
