The WP Content Copy Protection plugin uses aggressive techniques in protecting your valuable site content (text, source, images) from being stolen.

== Description ==

WP Content Copy Protection is a simple, yet aggressive plugin that uses multiple techniques in protecting your content from being stolen. Some of the most common copy methods (via mouse, keyboard and browser), such as right-click, image dragging, image saving, text selection, source code viewing and keyboard copy shortcuts, such as CTRL A, C, X, U, S, and P are disabled with this plugin. 

This is a plugin with teeth - an absolute must for any business owner, blogger and WordPress site owner who is serious about protecting his online text and image content! Simple, effective, lightweight!

**Basic Features**

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will WP Content Copy Protection Plugin have a negative impact on my SEO? =

Absolutely not! This plugin will only affect the client browser and will have absolutely no negative impact on your SEO. In fact, it would assist in increasing your SEO score as your content will remain unique.

= Will this plugin disable the features from the site administrator also? =

Yes! However, our Pro version allows the blog administrator to enable/disable copy protect functions for registered and logged in users (globally)

= Will your WP Content Copy Protection Plugin affect my Advertising Units (Adsense)? =

Absolutely not! Although this plugin locks your content and prevents it from being copied by anyone else, your advertising units will remain unaffected as the code doesn't alter any embeddable code or the functioning thereof.

= Why Did you Exclude The alert-message (Popup), Function? =

This function was removed simply because it could scare away your website visitors - cause a higher bounce rate - and essentially defame your website. We like to be silent! However, this is optional in our Pro edition.

= Does your Plugin work on all major Browsers? =

This plugin works on all major browsers and theme frameworks. The full functionality of WPCCP was tested on the latest versions of IE (Internet Explorer), Mozilla Firefox, Safari and Chrome without any problems.

= What is the difference between the free version and the pro version? =

The pro version includes super aggressive image protection (making it near impossible for a user to copy/steal your images), Prt Sc (print screen) deterrent agent, optional alert message for right click, RSS feed protection against content scraping software/autoblogs and much, much more! See our features above.

= Why did you remove the iframe breaker? =

We decided to remove the Iframe breaker due to conflict with theme appearance/customization.

= How would I break out of Iframes now? =

We have developed a small plugin that will act as an extension to WP Content Copy Protection. This plugin, WP noFrame/noClickjacking can be found [HERE](http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-noframenoclickjacking/). This plugin is a simple (yet) effective frame breaking plugin that protects your site content from being embedded into other sites - effectively defending you against clickjacking attacks. This is achieved by adding a Header always append X-Frame-Options DENY instruction to your .htaccess file - where the DENY rule will prevent ALL domains from framing your content.
