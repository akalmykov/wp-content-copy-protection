The WP Content Copy Protection plugin uses multiple techniques in copy-protecting your blog content.


== Description ==

WP Content Copy Protection is a simple plugin that uses multiple techniques in copy-protecting your blog content. Some of the most common copy methods, such as right click, image dragging, and keyboard copy shortcuts such as CTRL A, C, X, U, and P are disabled with this plugin. 

While this will most certainly help copy-protect your content, do remember that there are many other means one could use to get their hands on your content without using the context menu.

Wordpress Content Copy Protection PRO is now available !

Features

* iFrame Protection
* Disables right click function on mouse
* Disables image drag and drop function
* Disables 'Hold to Copy' function on most mobile devices
* Displays a client-side error message when Javascript is disabled
* Serves blank pages when JS is turned off in user browser (user is forced to enable JS)
* Disables keyboard copy commands (CTRL A, C, X, U, P) copy/paste/print/view source
* The image link URL is automatically removed and defaulted to the none setting in your image uploads (deters image theft)

PRO Version included features :

* Admin can exclude specific pages from being copy protected (all protection functions)
* Admin can disable/enable copy protection for registered and logged in users (non-registered users are still blocked)
* Added image protection (automatically layers all uplaoded images with a blank image). This means that even if the system is bypassed (Javascript disabled) and the user does manage to copy/save your images .. all images saves to his desktop will be blank !! Whether Javascript is turned ON or OFF , image theft is almost impossible with this plugin !
* Added text copy protection (automatically adds a silent Copyright notice to all posts in your site). This means that even if the system is bypassed (Javascript disabled) and the user does manage to copy/save any text from your site .. all copied content will include a silent Copyright notice back to your site (original author).
* Mozilla Firefox (updated v 23.0) removes ability for a user to disable Javascript ! Javascript is permanently turned on in this version (unless a user reverts back to a previous version). Chrome and IE remains the same in user control.
* WPCCP is fully compatible with the latest WP versions (3.5 and 3.6)
* WPCCP is fully compatible with all major browsers

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will WP Content Copy Protection Plugin have a negative impact on my SEO? =

No! This plugin will only affect the user's browser (attempting to copy your content) and will have NO negative impact on your SEO.

= Will this plugin disable the features from the site administrator also? =

Yes ! However, our PRO version allows the admin to enable/disable copy protect functions for registered and logged in users

= Will your WP Content Copy Protection Plugin affect my Advertising (Adsense)? =

Absolutely not! Although this plugin locks your content and prevents it from being copied by anyone else, your advertising blocks will remain UN-touched and UN-affected. These blocks will function without any trouble, and will work with Adsense, Chitika, as well as most other advertising programs.

= Why Did you Exclude The 'alert-message' (Popup) Function? =

This function was removed mainly due to the fact that it could scare away your website visitors - cause a higher bounce rate - and essentially defame your website.

= Does your Plugin work on all major Browsers? =

This plugin works on all major browsers. The full functionality (features) of this plugin was tested on the latest versions of IE (Internet Explorer), Mozilla FF, and Chrome without any problems.

= Why did you Decide to Re-enable Text Selection ? =

The text selection function was re-enabled simply to give users more "freedom" (knowing that even with text selection - they are still unable to actually copy any selected text). This way, the users are also LESS aware of the actual protection running in the backend (in hope of decreasing bounce rate).
